Client Overview and Software Requirements:
The Client: The Gaming Room.
Software Requirement: The client wanted a cross-platform application for their game, "Draw It or Lose It," with functionality to handle multiple teams competing in guessing drawings.

Strength in Developing Documentation:
I particularly excelled in analyzing the client’s needs and translating them into a clear, detailed design document. This included specifying functionality, user interaction, and system requirements to ensure a robust and scalable application.

Value of the Design Document:
The design document provided a clear roadmap for development, helping identify potential challenges early on and ensuring alignment with the client’s goals. It was especially useful in defining the system architecture, class diagrams, and feature priorities.

Revisions and Improvements:
If I could revise one part, I would improve the clarity and depth of the system architecture diagrams. This could be enhanced by incorporating more specific flowcharts and UML diagrams to better visualize the relationships between components.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs:
I interpreted the user’s needs by thoroughly analyzing the client’s requirements and engaging in iterative refinement. This involved prioritizing ease of use, cross-platform compatibility, and scalability. Understanding the user’s perspective ensures the software meets expectations and drives satisfaction.

Approach to Software Design:
I used a structured approach, starting with requirement analysis, creating mockups, and breaking down features into manageable tasks. In the future, I’d emphasize:

Iterative Prototyping: Quickly iterating on designs to validate assumptions.:
User Stories: Focusing on user-centric stories to ensure functionality aligns with real-world usage.
Collaborative Feedback: Involving stakeholders throughout the design process to address their needs effectively.
